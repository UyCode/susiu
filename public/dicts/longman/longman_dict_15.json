The Soviet Union was the largest country in the world and was made up of 15 republics (=separate nations), the most important of which was Russia. It was formed after the  russian revolution in 1917 as a Communist state, led by  lenin. For a long time it was one of the most powerful countries in the world, with a large army and many modern weapons, and it was regarded as the enemy of the US and western Europe during the  cold war. Its political system was controlled by the Communist Party. Ordinary people had little power and were not allowed to leave the Soviet Union, although a small number of people defected ( defect ) to the west  (=escaped to live in other countries). Mikhail  gorbachev, who was leader of the Soviet Union from 1985 to 1991, introduced many political and economic changes and, partly as a result of this, the Soviet Union began to break up as many of the republics got rid of their Communist governments and made themselves independent."

Arthur became king of Britain when he succeeded in pulling a sword called Excalibur out of a stone \u2013 something that only the person who would be king could do. Arthur is known for being brave, fair, and morally good. His court at Camelot was famous for bravery, chivalry, and magic which was practised by the  magician  Merlin, and the  sorceress  Morgan le Fay. There, at the  round table, sat the bravest  knights in the land, the  knights of the round table. These knights included Sir  Galahad, Sir  Lancelot, and Sir Bedivere. Arthur\u2019s power began to fail when he discovered the love between his wife, Guinevere, and his best friend, Lancelot, and the knights began the long search for the  holy grail (=the cup used by Jesus Christ at his last meal) which was finally found and brought back by Galahad. Arthur\u2019s strength then returned and he went into battle to save Britain from  Mordred, an evil knight. Arthur killed Mordred, but he was seriously wounded. He gave Excalibur to Bedivere and ordered him to throw it into a lake. When he did this, the hand of the  lady of the lake appeared from under the water, caught the sword, and disappeared under the water with it. Then three women arrived on a boat and took Arthur to the island of  Avalon to die. It is said that Arthur will return if Britain is ever in danger again."
