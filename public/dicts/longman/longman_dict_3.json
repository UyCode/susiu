After the Soviet soldiers left in 1989, there was a civil war (=war between different groups of people from the same country), and in 1996 the Taliban took control of large parts of the country. The Taliban allowed Osama Bin Laden, who was responsible for the September 11 attacks in the US, to establish military bases in Afghanistan. The US believed that al-Qaeda fighters were being trained at these bases. When the Taliban refused to say where Osama Bin Laden was, the US attacked the country in 2001.

She was arrested and sent to prison despite claiming at her trial that she had been forced to help the group. In 1979, President Jimmy Carter ordered that she should be allowed to leave prison, and in 2001 President Bill Clinton gave her a pardon.
