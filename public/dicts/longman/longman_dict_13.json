The American civil war started soon after he became president, when the Southern states decided to leave the US. In 1863 he announced the emancipation proclamation, by which all slaves in the US became free people. He also gave a famous speech known as the gettysburg address in 1863. A few days after the war ended, he was shot and killed in a theatre by an actor called John Wilkes booth. Lincoln is considered to be one of the most important US presidents, and was sometimes called \u2018Honest Abe\u2019 because everyone admired his honesty.
