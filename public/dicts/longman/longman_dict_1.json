Scottish Gaelic is still spoken by some people in the northwest of the country and in the islands off the west coast. Scotland is known for its beautiful countryside and its many lochs (=lakes), islands, and mountains. When people think of Scotland, they often think of men wearing kilts (=a sort of skirt of thick woollen cloth, with a tartan pattern) and playing the bagpipes (=a type of Scottish musical instrument). Products that are thought of as very typical of Scotland include the haggis (=a food in the shape of a ball, made from chopped up sheep\u2019s meat and grains) and Scotch whisky.
