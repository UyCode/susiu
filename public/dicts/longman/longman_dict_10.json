Her ideas become known as Thatcherism, and under her leadership politics in the UK became much more right-wing. During her time as prime minister, the Conservative government reduced taxes, took away power from trade unions, and started a programme of privatization (=selling state-owned services such as electricity and gas, so that they became private companies). She was seen as a strong and determined leader who would not change her mind easily and would not accept disagreement among her ministers. For this reason, she was sometimes called \u2018the Iron Lady\u2019."

He was popular with ordinary people but disliked by the prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, who eventually closed down the GLC. He was a Labour MP for several years, and was on the left wing of the party. In 2000, he was expelled (expel) from the party because he wanted to stand in the election for mayor of London but was not the official Labour candidate. He won the election as an independent and became a popular mayor. He was allowed to rejoin the party in 2004 and won the next election for mayor. As mayor of London (2000\u20132008) he was known for introducing the congestion charge, a payment which drivers have to make if they want to drive in certain parts of the city."

Zimbabwe was formerly called Rhodesia, and its main products include tobacco, cloth, and minerals. It was ruled by the British from 1889. In 1965 its white government announced that it was independent, but the British government regarded this as an illegal claim. In 1980 Zimbabwe became officially independent under a new mainly black government, and Robert Mugabe became the prime minister. When he was elected president in 1987, Mugabe began a process that made it legal for the government to take control of land that was owned by white people without giving them any money for it. This land was usually given to \u2018 war veterans\u2019 who had fought to make Zimbabwe independent. After Mugabe\u2019s reelection in 2002 Zimbabwe was  suspended from the Commonwealth because many countries thought the election was not fair or honest. In 2003, Zimbabwe officially decided to leave the Commonwealth. Mugabe was reelected in 2005. The opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), again complained that the elections had not been fair. In the 2008 elections, the Zimbabwe election  commission announced that Mugabe\u2019s ZANU-PF party had lost control of the Parliament. This was followed by a disagreement about who should be president."
