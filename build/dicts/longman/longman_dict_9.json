Instead of helping her, the English queen, Elizabeth I (who was her cousin) put her in prison. Many Catholics believed Mary should have been Queen of England instead of Elizabeth, who was a Protestant. Eventually Elizabeth ordered Mary to be killed, because she believed Mary was involved in a secret plan to kill her. After Elizabeth's death, Mary's son James, who was the King of Scotland, also became the King of England (as james i). Mary had three husbands, and had an exciting and romantic life, and many stories and books have been written about her."

Angry feelings on both sides led to the Boston Massacre and the Boston Tea Party and the war itself began in 1775. General George Washington led the American soldiers and was later helped by the French. In 1776 the Continental Congress rang the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia to tell the people about the Declaration of Independence.

For example, in 1992 Damien Hirst showed a work consisting of a shark kept in formaldehyde, and in 1999 Tracey Emin\u2019s work called My Bedwas actually her unmade bed.
