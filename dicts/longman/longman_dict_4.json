But he put the boys in prison in the Tower of London (the Princes in the Tower). They disappeared and he took the position of king for himself. He was later killed at the Battle of Bosworth Field. In Shakespeare\u2019s play Richard III, Richard is shown as a cruel and ugly man, and as a  hunchback (=person with a large raised part on their back), but some writers now believe that he was in fact an effective king and a brave military leader, who was not responsible for the deaths of the princes.
