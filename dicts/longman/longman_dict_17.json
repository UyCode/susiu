Victoria herself is supposed to have said \u2018We are not amused\u2019 when someone told her something funny.

When Aladdin finds the lamp and rubs it, a genie (=a creature with special powers) appears and says to Aladdin, \u2018Your wish is my command,\u2019 by which he means that Aladdin may ask for anything he wants and the genie will give it to him. Aladdin keeps the lamp and, with the genie\u2019s help, becomes rich and marries the sultan's daughter. Then the magician, by offering \u2018new lamps for old\u2019, tricks Aladdin\u2019s wife so that she exchanges the old magic lamp for an ordinary one. Aladdin finally finds the magician, kills him, and gets the magic lamp back again.

When Egypt took control, the UK and France sent ships and soldiers to the area to try to get the canal back. This attempt failed, and it was criticized by most other countries, including the US and the former Soviet Union. The British and French forces left Egypt after a few months, and the British prime minister, Anthony Eden, gave up his position as a result of this. For many people in the UK, the Suez Crisis was a serious defeat and a sign that the UK was no longer an important international power. In the UK, the Suez Crisis is often simply called Suez."

For many years the relationship between Libya and the West was not good. In 1986 the US bombed Libya, and two men from Libya were blamed when a US plane exploded over Lockerbie in Scotland in 1988. Libya attempted to improve its relationship with the West by admitting that it was responsible for Lockerbie and announcing that it did not intend to develop weapons of mass destruction. In 2011, following a civil war, NATO military forces helped to remove Libya's leader, Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, from power.
