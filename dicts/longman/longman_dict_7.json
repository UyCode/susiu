Because of its large Hispanic population and its nearness to Latin America, many companies in Miami do a lot of business with companies in Central and South America. During the 1980s, the city became known as a centre of the illegal drugs trade, and in the past it had more murders than most other US cities."

            "(1920\u201396)  an American writer and psychologist who believed that controlled use of the drug LSD could change people\u2019s lives in a positive way. He is known for saying \u2018Turn on, tune in, drop out\u2019. In 1963 he was forced to leave his job as a psychology professor at Harvard University because he had been doing experiments with LSD on students. He continued his experiments at a large house in New York called Millbrook, but was put in prison. The Weather Underground Organization, a communist terrorist group, helped him to escape, but he was later caught in Switzerland and taken back to the US."

He believed that bad experiences that people have as children can affect their mental health as adults, and that by talking to a mentally ill person about their past life and feelings, the hidden causes of their illness can be found.
